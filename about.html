            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p> Welcome! 
                I’m a passionate graphic designer with a keen eye for detail and a love for visual storytelling. With 2 years of experience in the industry, I specialize in creating engaging brand identities, innovative print designs, and editorial work.
                
                My journey in design began with a fascination for all things art and communication related, leading me to earn my BFA in Fine Arts with specialization in Graphic Design from The College of New Jersey. Since then, I’ve had the privilege of working with a diverse range of clients, from startups to established brands, helping them bring their visions to life.
                
                I believe that great design should not only look good but also resonate with its audience. My approach combines creativity with strategic thinking, ensuring that every project meets both aesthetic and functional goals.
                When I'm not designing, I love exploring art museums, running, reading, or enjoying time with friends & family typically over a good cup of coffee & meal.
