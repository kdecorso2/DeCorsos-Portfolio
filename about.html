          >Welcome! <br />I’m a passionate graphic designer with a keen eye for
          detail and a love for visual storytelling. With 2 years of experience
          in the industry, I specialize in creating engaging brand identities,
          innovative print designs, and editorial work.<br /><br />My journey in
          design began with a fascination for all things art and communication
          related, leading me to earn my BFA in Fine Arts with specialization in
          Graphic Design from The College of New Jersey. Since then, I’ve had
          the privilege of working with a diverse range of clients, from
          startups to established brands, helping them bring their visions to
          life.<br /><br />I believe that great design should not only look good
          but also resonate with its audience. My approach combines creativity
          with strategic thinking, ensuring that every project meets both
          aesthetic and functional goals.<br />When I'm not designing, I love
          exploring art museums, running, reading, or enjoying time with friends
          & family typically over a good cup of coffee & meal.<br /><br />Let’s
          chat and create something you love!
